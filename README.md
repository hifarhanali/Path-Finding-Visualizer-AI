# Path-Finding-Visualizer-AI
A*, LRTA* and RTA* algorithms simulation in python with different heuristic functions including eucledian distance, manhattan disrance and octile distance.

# How to run the visualizer?
    - Open terminal and go to the directory that contain `main.py` file.
    - Type `python3 main.py` on terminal and hit enter.
    - The simulator will be opened on a new screen.

# How to use visualizer?
    - Left click -> to add a start, end, or an obstacle node.
    - right click -> to remove a start, end, or an obstacle node.
    - Press 1 -> to start simulation with A* algorithm.
    - Press 2 -> to start simulation with Learning Real-Time A* algorithm.
    - Press 3 -> to start simulation with Real-Time A* algorithm.
    - Press SPACE -> to reset grid (obstacles, start and end nodes will not be removed).
    - Press ESCAPE -> to quit.
